**Description:** I predict the concentration of gold during the gold purification process based on historical data.

**Conclusions:** Having analyzed the concentrations of substances at different stages of purification, we can conclude that the purification is correct, the concentration of gold increases, extraneous substances are being removed from the mixture. After filling in the data and describing the whole process, it was possible to start building the model. The best model for predicting the gold recovery rate from ore was RandomForestRegressor

**Tools:** Matplotlib,NumPy,Pandas,Python,Scikit-learn
