**Description:** I am developing a system to recommend the value of a car based on its description, mileage and other technical characteristics.

**Summary:** So after processing the data, filling in the gaps, removing outliers, we were able to train three machine learning models RF, Catboost, XGBoost. The gradient bousting models performed significantly faster than RF. For the final result, we used the XGBoost model.

**Tools:** Pandas,Python, sklearn, catboost
